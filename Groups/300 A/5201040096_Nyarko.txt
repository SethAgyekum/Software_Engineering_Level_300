Software process models are convenient tools that developers use to map every step of their projects. They help project managers plan their processes, estimate costs, identify challenges and communicate with teams and customers.
The key difference between Agile vs. Waterfall is that Waterfall breaks down software development into isolated phases that flow into each other, while Agile advocates iterative development cycles in which multiple lifecycle phases can run in parallel.Agile projects are typically cheaper and can be delivered quickly. They offer greater flexibility, but also produce less predictable results due to the uncertainty and unclear nature of many of the project characteristics. Waterfall projects are typically more expensive and take longer to deliver.
Rational Unified Process (RUP) is an agile software development methodology. RUP splits the project life cycle into four phases. During each of the phases, all six core development disciplines take place: business modelling, requirements, analysis and design, implementation, testing, and deployment.There are five phases of RUP that can help you decrease development costs, wasted resources and total project management time. Here's a detailed explanation of each phase. These include Inception,Elaboration,Construction,Transition and Production.
